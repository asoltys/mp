Web wallet

This web wallet generates a 12 word seed phrase and master private key with client side Javascript and prompts the user to encrypt the seed with a password. You can use it to create paper wallets for your liquid assets!

When a new payment is detected, the index is incremented so that a new address can be used for the next payment.
